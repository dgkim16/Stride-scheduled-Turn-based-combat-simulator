      <p>Title: Honkai StarRail simulator<br>
        https://github.com/dgkim16/optionalPRJsource<br>
        Summary:<br>
        This project aims to mimik the battle system used in a video game titled Honkai StarRail using RBT data structure.<br>
        Their battle system is inspired by, and therefore strongly resemblances that of, the series of video games called Persona.<br>
        There are two groups A, consisting of playable agents, and B, consisting of enemy agents, in this game.<br>
        Each agent has their own preassigned values, such as its name, skill ids, character id, speed, attack, max hp, and type.<br>
        All agents mimik the characters with the type 'hunt' from the original game, so their types are fixated.<br>
        Rounds are taken among all agents with resepct to their BAV values, which is initialized for each agent using their speed values.<br>
        The panels alligned vertically on the left edge of the screen are updated when appropriate to reflect the BAV values in real time.<br>
        The agent with the lowest BAV value takes the turn of that round, and all agents' BAV values are decremented by that lowest amount.<br>
        If the agent is playable, the game waits for input from the user. Otherwise, the enemy agent attacks an ally.<br>
        Which ally is attacked by the enemy agent, and equivalently the enemy agent automatically targeted by an playable agent in its turn, depends on their Hit probability.<br>
        Hit probability for each character is computed using the Aggro value for each agent, which is computed with respect to its predetermined type.<br>
        After the agent with the turn finished, if the game is not over, the agent that played the turn reset its BAV value, and the game goes on to ex\ecute the next round.</p>

      TODO list (2024.09.14)
      [] Fix ultimate bug
      [] "Generify" cinemachine placeholder prefabs
      [] Create Flow diagram (logic diagram)
      [] Change skill button mapping mechanism
      [] Divide 'current turn queue' into two queues : waitlist queue & action queue

      WISH list
      [] Update project to Unity to 6.0
      [] Use enums instead of hard coded int for implementation of IComparable in CharacterBattle
      [] Add miscalleneous setting UI (placeholder; for changing volume)
      [] Add save & load - save outputs copyable unique Progress Identifier "PID", and load lets user input the PID
      [] Add "Rounds"
